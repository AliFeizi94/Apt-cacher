APT-Cache-ng is a Life Saver for Situation which you do not want to Give Internet to Your Ubuntu Servers for Updating Packages

apt cahcher is a caching proxy for Debian based distributions that creates a local cache of Debian-based mirrors as well as other Linux distributions. This means that whenever a package is pulled from the official repositories, an APT cache server caches them such that if any other local machine would want to install the same package, it just pulls it from the local caching server. This helps eliminates the bottlenecks of slow internet connections.
